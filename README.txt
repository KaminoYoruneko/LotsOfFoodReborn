This is an unofficial attempt to update a mcmod called "Lots of Food"(with its revived version) to Minecraft 1.19.2(might be higher or lower in the future?) using forge.
我打算把Lots of Food这个mod非官方地移植到1.19.2 forge，之后可能会有低一点或者高一点的其他版本？

Reason for my doing this project:
打算移植的原因：
   1.I want to see sweet house again in higher versions of Minecraft.
     太经典了属于是，所以我打算把糖果屋整到新版本来）
   2.I want to try to create a mod of Minecraft by using my poor professional(T w T|) coding skills(which might improves it...).
     练一下mcmod编写方面的技能，顺便练一下拙劣的编程水平）
   3.I ran out of my reasons...x_x
     编不出来了）

It's appreciated if you want to contribute to this project and support this project.
如果有大佬来帮忙就好了）
